# Civilization 2.0

<!-- This comment is not rendered visibly to web.

Feel free to edit this page.

Please use these special conventions for Sidebar pages:

Use `# Headers` to separate sections.

Instead of bullet lists, use plain lines, with two space characters added to the end of lines. That makes a line break. (Otherwise, the lines will wrap onto one line.)
