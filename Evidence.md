## Who is leading us towards 2.0?

Here I showcase examples of already operating organizations, individuals and countries that display 2.0 qualities and opinions. They exemplify how to thrive as a 2.0 entity within 1.0. We hope this list will eventually provide significant indication that our transition to 2.0 is underway, being explored and tested. Each entry's title is a hyperlink.

Also, I like to think that when you spend on (or donate money to) these entities, you are strengthening efforts to usher in 2.0.

I want your [suggestions](mailto:sand@gizmolab.com) regarding who or what to add here.

### [Bhutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan)

Bhutan a Buddhist kingdom on the Himalayas’ eastern edge, is known for its monasteries, fortresses (or dzongs) and dramatic landscapes that range from subtropical plains to steep mountains and valleys. In the High Himalayas, peaks such as 7,326m Jomolhari are popular trekking destinations. Paro Taktsang monastery (also known as Tiger’s Nest) clings to cliffs above the forested Paro Valley. It has the least corrupt government as of 2016, and its constitution declares gross national happiness as the goal of governance.

### [Buhddism](https://tibet.net/)

The practice of tearing down your negativity can help you in reconstructing yourself as what I like to think of as a 2.0 self.

### [Burning Man](https://www.burningman.org/)

Once past the entry fees and ignoring the growing corporate influences, all your basic needs are free. This is as close an example of pure 2.0 in which you can spend a week immersed.

### [Copiosis](https://copiosis.com/)

Like me, they consider benefit to be a better basis for an economy.

### [Costco](http://www.costco.com/)

They care about your experience and about the quality of their goods and services. Returning items is pleasant and quick. Prices are often below average. Employees are nice and go the extra distance for you. If you accidentally break something, they do not require that you buy it.

### [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/)

These folks are going in the same direction, and are way ahead of me in lots of ways. Wow!

### [Game B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sic9HVBeLRc&fbclid=IwAR0_U0rTp-iWKeJMjtTwD28HQpdi9111-SToqUdTk87Gp95Bv0KHZR9CyOI)

An excellent focus on three core problems which cause all civilizations so far (aka Game A) to eventually crumble. Solving all of them is the goal of Game B, and ours as well.

### [Higher Status Global](https://higherstatusglobal.com/)

What if our economy were not compromised by unethical and careless motives? Higher Status Global is using AI to invest in and promote healthy and sustainable enterprises.

### [Non-Violent Communication](http://www.nvcsantacruz.org/)

Various centers around the world teach how to communicate feelings and needs. They have an extensive track record of transforming long-standing disagreement, violence and anger into peace and agreement. This is the best manifestation of being nice and being honest that we have encountered.

### [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/)

They are completely 2.0. Everything is free and of high quality. They are vigilant about honesty.

## Each of these articles probe the same issues and come to conclusions similar to ours

### [Paul Mason](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/26/clear-bright-future-by-paul-mason-review-radical-optimism)

An article about optimism, similar to mine.

### [Post-Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-capitalism)

This is a slightly different approach than the one I favor, but it has been studied deeply and read widely.

### [Radical Evil](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-age-of-radical-evil/)

An article which does an excellent job of describing our current cultural climate as evil.

### [The Guardian](https://amp.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/17/postcapitalism-end-of-capitalism-begun?__twitter_impression=true&fbclid=IwAR1necgu-86iKM5J2DPpdxRfii7u-v7KGqT8-3wxH4UPaPaRvcykUwX3SMs)

An article describing economic forces that are helping to usher in 2.0.

## I love mom and pop ventures

I am brokenhearted over the demolition of the creative passion that used to lurk behind producers, manufactures and purveyors of goods and services. The corner grocery stores and bodegas are replaced by the 7 Eleven and Stop and Go. Small farmers of all kinds are replaced by mega farming and Safeway. To me this seems a rejection of gigantic global quantities of passion and creative spirit.

I want to bring it back. So, here I'd like to show my love and appreciation for some currently thriving examples close to where I happen to live.

### [Family Wellness Center](http://www.feltonchiro.com/)

The quality of care they provide is very high. Being nice seems to come to them easily and naturally.

### Gloria Jimenez

She is kind, gentle, happy and works amazingly hard.

### [Los Amigos Taqueria](http://taquerialosamigosbouldercreek.mybistro.online/)

Their portions are ample, their attitude is gracious.

### [The Furnace Room](http://www.furnaceroom.com/)

Their prices are low and their quality high. Their warranty is solid and real. Their word is reliable.

### [The Red Pearl](http://www.redpearlonline.com/)

Cheerful service, huge variety of great Chinese food.
