## Global Optimism

I believe that our civilization has reached a state of negativity, hostility, and exhaustion for too many of us and feel that typical desire to so something about it. Trust in others has eroded, skepticism prevails, and we expect to be deceived, betrayed, and bombarded with falsehoods. Our online existence is filled with complexities, passwords, and the constant threat of predators. Junk mail, advertisements, disinformation, and petty crimes consume our attention. Robot intelligence adds to our misery with unwanted calls, scams, and frustrating user experiences. We have normalized a culture of junk, violence, riots, manipulation, and neglect.

This is an absurd way for our species to treat itself. Very few other species behave in such a manner. We are intelligent beings who have accomplished much for ourselves, and now it is time to move forward.

Naturally, we desire better. We yearn for a world in which we want to live—a world with a thriving economy that prioritizes the long-term well-being of all individuals, not just a select few. We seek lives filled with meaning, passion, and self-expression. I refer to this envisioned world as "speculative world civilization 2.0."

However, how can we bring about such an improvement? I don't possess all the answers, but I strongly believe that we must seek solutions. If we fail to do so, all our species has achieved may be overshadowed and potentially doomed. Despite my negative reactions to the current state of affairs, I have faith in our species' ability to solve difficult problems. I reach out with optimism, searching for answers.

The journey toward a better world must begin with a clear agreement on what defines 2.0. After pondering this for six years, I have distilled my thoughts into five goals:

1. Maximize the reliability of all information sources without suppressing individual opinions.
2. Drive the manufacture and distribution of goods and services based on existing needs, not solely on profit.
3. Provide excellent education and training that prepares us to be ethical, benevolent, and adaptable to increased inventiveness. We need an education system that fosters both individual and collective thinking.
4. Establish a foolproof repository of diverse opinions that accurately represents each and every one of us. This repository should guide large-scale decisions and the selection of decision-makers.
5. Elevate the importance of meaning, passion, creativity, genuine needs, and relationships over consumerism.

Do these goals resonate with you?

To embark on this path, we must set aside the stories that tell us it's impossible or that we lack the knowledge. Let us embrace the belief that we can accomplish this, even if we do not yet have a detailed plan. I would like to present the case that we are likely to develop a robust plan. I have a couple of ideas that, although still vague, hold promise: collective intelligence and empathy.

As an intelligent species, we possess a wide range of capabilities, including language, technology, culture, and creativity. What we lack is the training to unlock our collective intelligence—the deep understanding of ourselves and each other, along with rational rules of engagement. As we acquire these skills, we will gradually become more intelligent as a group.

Here's the good news: this training is already emerging. It primarily exists outside of academia, but it offers valuable insights. It's challenging to describe convincingly, but once experienced, it becomes evident as a compelling answer to the question of how. In simple terms, we need to learn to communicate with each other, considering each other's best interests.

In the meantime, glimpses of 2.0 are emerging here and there in the world. We are exploring various ways to implement 2.0 within the existing 1.0 framework. I have been collecting examples of robust and solid instances of 2.0 to build a case for optimism.
